# mkdocs-material-boilerplate

Adapted from Github peaceiris/mkdocs-material-boilerplate, with different goals:

- Remove parts that are not strictly necessary
- focus on python documentation with api reference
- build docs in same branch alongside current code: mkautodoc needs to import python library
- developer `scripts/` provided; these can be used directly or as a reference when setting up Continuous Integration.

See [https://terrabits.github.io/mkdocs-material-boilerplate/](https://terrabits.github.io/mkdocs-material-boilerplate/) for the end result.
